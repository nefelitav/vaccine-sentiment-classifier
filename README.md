# Vaccine Sentiment Classifier
In this project I trained machine learning and deep learning models in order to classify tweets as Neutral, Pro-vax or Anti-vax, experimenting with different configurations and metrics.

The models and their best accuracy scores:
- Logistic Regression: 0.7230
- Feedforward Neural Network: 0.6520
- LSTM: 0.7050
- GRU: 0.7063
- Bert pretrained model: 0.7751
